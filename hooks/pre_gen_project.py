*** WARNING ***

This template was adapted from the cookiecutter data science template 
(see https://github.com/drivendata/cookiecutter-data-science). It uses
poetry instead of anaconda, and adds some tools such as pre-commit and 
bumpversion to the dependencies. Not everything is covered by tests yet.
